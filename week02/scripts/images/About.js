export function aboutMe() {const aboutMe = "    Hello, my name is John Trok, and I am currently working at Mobility Physical Therapy as the front desk manager. The head therapist and I started a new branch of Mobility Physical Therapy in 2013, and it grew from a two-treatment table area inside a gym to six treatment tables in our own office space with our equipment. Working there for the past eight years has enhanced my soft skills and taught me what it takes to open a business. Back at school, I found BYU Idaho’s online certificates and bachelor’s degrees a great option. \n" +
    "    Goals from my education, I really would like to be a programmer. I have enjoyed my python coding classes, and the growth potential is endless. It is an inventive space to be in the world right now. Currently, I’m creating a program to help with billing. Seeing problems in new lights with code is fantastic, and I have only scratched the surface. I’m so happy to be back in school and growing in new ways. \n" +
    "    The eight ways to hit goals with school ensure healthy growth. First, get my work done early. Getting ahead in my schoolwork allows me to spend more time with my wife and family. Second, organize my schedule with my calendar. Having a clear plan allows my wife to understand my current task and see the time I have and need. Third, exercise goals. I need physical goals for stress relief; when I go to the gym or train at home, I don’t play with my phone or listen to music or podcasts. I have my list of tasks to accomplish, working through my stress with a physical outlet and studying Christ’s teaching. I keep this basic because I have a lot on my plate: attending church, praying, studying the bible, and reflecting. Fifth, take time to reflect. I try to journal at least every Sunday, writing things I did well, things I want to improve, and at least one milestone in the week. Sixth tied together with the fifth, I review my calendar for the previous week and the upcoming week, planning out what I can. Seventh, I make sure I have at least one day with my family. I don’t think about school, work, bills, the gym, or the calendar during that time. I focus on them and our moments with that focused time. Eight, accepting failure and chaos. Things will fall apart, fall through, mistakes happen, people need more than you have, and you will miss out on activities. I have chosen to go back to school and enhance my future. There is an emotional, time-consuming tax for this endeavor to succeed. \n"
